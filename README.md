# FLORA_JY-MCU_BT_DEMO

Basically uses Software Serial example for Arduino, and the Simple Write example for Processing but modded for the FLORA.
Must use the the USB to upload code to FLORA. 
Also must use SoftwareSerial Library for Arduino. 
Remember wiring between JY-MCU and FLORA must be so that RX of one connects to the TX of the other, and TX of one connects to the RX of the other.
